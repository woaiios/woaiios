# Database File Placeholder

This placeholder file indicates that `ecdict-top10k.db.gz` should be placed in this directory.

## For Development/Testing

The actual database file (~2MB) is not committed to version control due to size.

To deploy with full dictionary functionality:
1. Generate or obtain the `ecdict-top10k.db.gz` file (see DICTIONARY_DATABASE.md)
2. Place it at `public/ecdict-top10k.db.gz`
3. Rebuild and deploy

The application will work without this file using fallback difficulty scoring, but will not have:
- Accurate BNC frequency-based difficulty ratings
- Phonetic transcriptions
- English definitions
- Chinese translations
- Word form variations (exchange data)
